# Check_V1.3
A checker game with players of 2, 3 and 6. No need to setup.
This is actually a homework of school, made by Liu Yuming and Lu Zihao, both of whom are from HITsz.
If you want to play this game, make sure you download the exe and dir called res, and put them into the same dir.


If you want to use the cpp file, you should install packages of easyx.
Although this is a well-organized game, we strongly recommand you to try to write this code yourself, if you are also a student in colloege that are assigned this homework.
It's not so difficult as it seems to be.


You may not play with computer currently, although we have set that choice.
But we may update a in a few weeks using the nerual network.
